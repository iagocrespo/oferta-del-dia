## 0. Installation and First Steps

### How to install Node

Since we are using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), we need to:

1. Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

```
❯ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

2. Install [fish-nvm](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm)

```
❯ fisher add FabioAntunes/fish-nvm
```

3. Install [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/en/) with NVM

```
❯ nvm install 8
❯ node --version
v8.12.0
❯ nvm alias default 8.12.0
```

### How can I sync the project with a remote GitHub repository

```
❯ git remote add git@github.com:iagocrespo/oferta-del-dia.git
❯ git push -u origin master
```

### More tools

- [React Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) extension for Firefox.
- [CMDer](http://cmder.net/): Command Line Emulator for Windows.

### Info de React

- Todo en React es un componente.
- Un componente es una pieza reusable de tu pagina web.
- WebPack es un agrupador.
- Hot Reloading: es lo que hace que el navegador se vaya actualizando en tiempo real.

### How to declare a component

Both are equivalent

```jsx
class Dave extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>"What do you think you are doing, Dave?"</p>;
  }
}
```

```jsx
const Dave = () => {
  return <p>"What do you think you are doing, Dave?"</p>;
};
```

### Component structure

```jsx
// IMPORTS
import React from "react";

// COMPONENT
class Dave extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>;
  }
}

// EXPORT
export default Dave;
```

### To JSX or to not JSX...

#### With only one tag

Both are equivalent

```jsx
<p>What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>
```

```js
React.createElement("p", {}, "What do you think you are doing, Dave?");
```

#### With nested tags

Both are equivalent

```jsx
<div>
  <p>What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>
</div>
```

```js
React.createElement(
  "div",
  {},
  React.createElement("p", {}, "What do you think you are doing, Dave?")
);
```

### JSX Gotchas!

#### Use `className` instead of `class`

```jsx
return <p className="my-class">What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>;
```

#### Beware ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion)

If you leave `return` alone in one line a semicolon is automatically inserted! Use `return ( .... )`.

```jsx
return (
  <div>
    <p className="my-class">What do you think you are doing, Dave?</p>
  </div>
);
```

## 2. `props` and `state`

- `state`: where the data lives.
- `props`: a way to get data (`state`) into a component.

## 3. Functional Stateless Components

Five of them are equivalent

```jsx
class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h3 className="tagline">
        <span>{this.props.tagline}</span>
      </h3>
    );
  }
}
```

```jsx
const Header = props => {
  return (
    <h3 className="tagline">
      <span>{props.tagline}</span>
    </h3>
  );
};
```

```jsx
const Header = ({ tagline }) => {
  return (
    <h3 className="tagline">
      <span>{tagline}</span>
    </h3>
  );
};
```

```jsx
const Header = props => (
  <h3 className="tagline">
    <span>{props.tagline}</span>
  </h3>
);
```

```jsx
const Header = ({ tagline }) => (
  <h3 className="tagline">
    <span>{tagline}</span>
  </h3>
);
```

## 4. Routing and Routers

There's at least 3 great options for routing in React:

- [`react-router`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- [`next.js`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#routing)
- [`@reach/router`](https://reach.tech/router)

We are going to use `@reach/router` but there's a branch with `react/router` too [here](https://github.com/davidgchaves/oferta-del-dia/tree/react-router)

## 5. Events in React

[Synthetic Events in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)

Hey React! When somebody clicks the button, execute this (`handleClick`) 👇 function, please:

```jsx
<button onClick={this.handleClick}>
```

## 6. Binding `this` inside a Component

Binding our own methods/functions inside a `component`

### Method 1: Inside a `constructor`

```jsx
class StorePicker extends React.Component {
constructor (props) {
  super(props)

  this.goToStore =this.goToStore.bind(this)
}


goToStore(event) {}
```

### Method 2: Declare a `property` instead of `method`/`function` inside the component

```jsx
class StorePicker extends React.Component {
  goToStore = event => {};
}
```

**Remember**: if you must accsess `this` inside a custom method/function in a component, you need to blind `this` with method 1 or even better using Method 2

## 7. State in React

- **State** is a JavaScript Object that lives inside a component and contains all the data components and probably its cgildren need.

- **State** is just an JavaScript Object that holds data.

React philosophy: Update the data (state) and let it React take it and update components for us

You can never pass data up, you can only pass data down.

Functions that update state and the state itself nood to be in the same component.

### Deploying To Now

[Now — Global Serverless Deployments](https://zeit.co/now)

```
❯npm install -g now
❯now -v
12.1.3
```

Change `start` scripts to `dev` scripts and make a new `start` script that runs the production build

```json

"scripts": {
    "dev": "react-scripts start",
}
```

Create a `now.json` file at the root of your project

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "^/static/(.*)", "dest": "/static/$1" },
    { "src": ".*", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

Create a custom alias

```

❯now alias https://oferta-del-dia-2s72oqmaq.now.sh obradoiroteoKLK

You can enter to obradoiroteoKLK.now.sh

```
